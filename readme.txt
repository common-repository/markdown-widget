Allows authors to enter text using the Markdown syntax in the sidebar

== Description ==

This plugin allows users familiar with the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
to use it from within the sidebar. Its chief benefit is that it allows
users who are unfamiliar with HTML, to get many of the benefits of a
robust markup language, which is easier to learn and read back.

This plugin uses [Markdown Extra](http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown) by Michel Fortin

== Installation ==

1. Upload `markdown-widget` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Basic use ==

1. Drop the `Markdown Text` widget onto a sidebar
2. Enter a title for the widget
3. Enter the main body of your text below the title, using the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
